# Python-GUI-Basic-Projects
Learning tkinter library with some simple projects!

I started with Odd_or_Even, a basic tool to calculate whether a user inputted number is an odd number or an even number. 
The underlying function is simple enough, but I learned about try blocks to catch any non-integer inputs so that the code didn't break. 
HOWEVER, after working with the tkinter library and making a retrieve function, I realizied that I needed a way to have my submit button provide the input to my function and for the output of that function to be shown in the GUI.
